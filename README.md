 Astroids 3D - A project from a 3 man team focusing on the use of WebGL.  Inspired by the retro game “Asteroids”, control a stationary ship to defend yourself from oncoming asteroids. The main scripting languages used were JavaScript and HTML5, making use of the APIs “WebGL” and “3JS”. The project’s purpose was to show that our team could utilize a computer’s dedicated GPU to render a scene, camera, and lighting from a web browser. Materials, meshes, realistic lighting, and shadow mapping were used.

 Virtual Machine & Compiler for primitive coding project - Created a compiler, run from the console, that processes a custom .pl0 file into machine language, which is then run on a virtual machine. Everything being custom-made made in class.
 
 Virtual Stack - A full-stack MERN application that is meant to bring business cards up to the modern age, utilizing smart phones and QR codes. Our team created a database, web app, android app, and API to link them. I used Android Studios IDE and the Java scripting language to produce the frontend of the android app.
